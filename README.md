# BB8_Droid_2.0

This is my second attempt at building a functional BB-8 replica from the movie Star Wars: The Force Awakens.  In my first iteration, I had little knowledge of motors and the mechanics behind the movement.  After doing more research, and looking at the works of previous builders, I have come up with a new design which I believe is better in virtually every way, other than cost.

The design is based mainly on the Red Carpet BB-8 (Lucasfilm official droid), with the practicalities of the designs in the BB-8 Builder's Club.  It is designed to have every degree of motion that the offical droid has, combined with the most programmability that I can add.

Improvements made:
- All metal structure for rigidity and strength
- Motors with the power necessary to move the droid and head
- Internal measurements available for almost every motor group (means zero reliance on head accelerometer)
- Center of mass is lower, increasing stability
- More efficient use of space, with a larger platform to place electronics
- Using Arduino for control instead of a Raspberry Pi means instant on/off, and more ease changing code

Downsides:
- There are not currently plans to have a way to keep track of how the ball is rotating.
